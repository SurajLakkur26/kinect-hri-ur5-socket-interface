# kinect-hri-ur5-socket-interface
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Kinect-based gesture and posture tracking pipeline that streams skeletal joint positions and joint angles over a TCP socket for human-robot interaction (HMI). The current implementation targets a UR5 robot as the client, with Kinova robot integration planned only as future work.
